# Intentional Browsing

A browser extension that adds a mindful barrier before accessing distracting websites, helping you browse the internet more intentionally.

## Features

- **Mindful Blocking**: Redirects you to a reflection screen before accessing blocked sites
- **Intentional Access**: Requires you to provide a thoughtful reason (minimum 100 characters) before proceeding
- **Time Awareness**: Set time limits for your visits with automatic redirection after the session expires
- **Visit History**: Track your browsing patterns with a day-by-day view of your site visits
- **Reflection Journal**: Post-visit reflection prompts to help you evaluate your browsing habits
- **Temporary Blocking**: Option to block yourself from sites for specified periods
- **Customizable Site List**: Easy management of which sites to block through the options page

## How It Works

1. **Block Setup**: Configure which websites you want to review before accessing
2. **Mindful Barrier**: When you try to visit a blocked site, you're redirected to a reflection screen
3. **Intentional Entry**: Provide a meaningful reason for your visit (minimum 100 characters)
4. **Time Commitment**: Set how long you plan to spend on the site
5. **Session Management**: Browse freely within your time limit
6. **Reflection**: When your session ends, reflect on your visit and its value
7. **History Tracking**: Review your browsing patterns and reflections over time
